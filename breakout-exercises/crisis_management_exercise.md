# Git Crisis Management Exercise - Theory Breakout

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Format:** Group discussion (no commands run)  
**Objective:** Think through how to respond to Git disasters under time pressure

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY SCENARIO

**ALERT:** You've just discovered that API keys were accidentally committed to your main branch **3 commits ago**. The repository is **PUBLIC** and the keys are **currently active** in your production system.

**Timeline:** This happened 2 hours ago. You need to respond immediately.

---

## Your Emergency Response (10 minutes, discussion)

### Phase 1: Immediate Damage Control (First 3 minutes)

**CRITICAL: What's your first action and why?**

Choose the correct first step:
- [ ] A) Remove the secrets from the current code
- [ ] B) Make the repository private
- [x] C) Rotate/revoke the compromised credentials immediately
- [ ] D) Delete the problematic commits

**Why is this the right first step?**
_________________________________

### Phase 2: Git History Cleanup (Next 4 minutes)

**Situation Assessment:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5
a1b2c3d Fix user authentication bug
e4f5g6h Update README documentation  
i7j8k9l Add production configuration  ← API keys are in this commit!
m1n2o3p Add user management features
q4r5s6t Initial project setup
```

**Discuss your Git recovery approach:**

**Option A: Safe Revert (if others might have pulled)**
```bash
git revert i7j8k9l
# Creates new commit that removes the secrets
```

**Option B: History Rewrite (if you're sure no one else pulled)**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# Remove the problematic commit entirely
```

**Which option would you choose and why?**
# Option A safe revert: since repo is public its easier to assume someone already pulled changes.

### Phase 3: Prevention Implementation (Last 3 minutes)

**Set up prevention measures:**

1. **Update .gitignore:**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
.env
config/secrets/
*.key
credentials.json
```

2. **Create pre-commit hook (example):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for secrets before commit
if grep -r "api_key\s*=" . ; then
    echo "❌ API key found! Use environment variables."
    exit 1
fi
```

3. **Document the incident:**
What would you write in your incident report?
some active API keys were accidentally shared in a public repository. As soon as the mistake was noticed, the keys were changed right away and the code was updated to remove them. We confirmed that the keys were not used by anyone while they were exposed. To prevent this from happening again, we added checks before code is shared and improved the list of files that should never be included in the repository

## Team Discussion (5 minutes)

**Share with your breakout room:**

### Crisis Response Questions:
1. **Speed vs. Safety:** When would you choose history rewrite vs. revert?
2. **Communication:** Who would you notify during this incident?
3. **Prevention:** What other security measures could prevent this?

### Git Command Practice:
1. **Have you used `git revert` vs `git rebase -i` before?**
2. **What's the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?**
3. **When is `git push --force` acceptable?**

### Real-World Experience:
1. **Has anyone experienced a similar incident?**
2. **What security practices does your workplace use?**
3. **How would your team handle credential rotation?**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong:** Trying to fix Git history before rotating credentials  
✅ **Right:** Rotate credentials first, then clean history

❌ **Wrong:** Using `git push --force` without checking with team  
✅ **Right:** Use `git push --force-with-lease` or coordinate with team

❌ **Wrong:** Only removing secrets from current code  
✅ **Right:** Remove from Git history too (if possible)

❌ **Wrong:** Not implementing prevention measures  
✅ **Right:** Set up hooks and scanning to prevent recurrence

---

## Git Recovery Commands Reference

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# See what changed in a commit
git show <commit-hash>

# Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, lose changes  
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo specific commit safely
git revert <commit-hash>

# Interactive rebase to edit history
git rebase -i HEAD~N

# Check if it's safe to force push
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Real-World Context

**This scenario is extremely common:**
- GitHub's secret scanning finds **millions** of exposed credentials
- **Average detection time:** 20 days for exposed secrets
- **Real impact:** AWS bills of $50,000+ from compromised keys
- **Legal implications:** GDPR fines, compliance violations

**Your response time matters:**
- **Under 1 hour:** Minimal impact if caught early
- **1-24 hours:** Moderate risk, require monitoring
- **Over 24 hours:** High risk, assume compromise

The skills you practice here directly protect production systems and prevent security incidents that can cost companies millions of dollars.
